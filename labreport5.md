# Lab Report 3

The command that I chose to research was less. The main use for less is to show the file's content. 

## 1. Opening Text Files

The first way we can use the less command is to open up files.

### First Example

In this first example, we use the less command to open up a file called `HandRHawaii.txt`.

<img width="485" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55414361/218594609-03ef5475-aa87-4b89-8589-10a30c7ba236.png">

The first picture shows the part where you run the command using less to see the content of the txt file. The second image shows the less command in use. The less command
shows us the main content of the file as well as showing the file name and path at the bottom left of the screen. This is useful for us because it allows us to go through
all the contents while using less' built in commands to navigate the file. 

### Second Example

<img width="396" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55414361/218595048-803dc27a-3df8-4c97-a430-468487543103.png">

<img width="1031" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55414361/218595032-d5941a8d-63a6-40f2-8721-449a0177e2e2.png">

In the first picture, I wanted to show what would happen if it we didn't use a proper file while using less. It will tell us that we gave the computer a directory and
will not go inside. The second picture shows me using less in a different file path and opening up a different txt file. The third image shows the content of the 
`ch1.txt` file. The less command is especially beneficial here because this file has so much content, meaning it would take a lot longer to load the whole file. Instead, 
less will access the file page by page, increasing the loading speed. 

## 2. Searching for a String

Another way we can use the less command is to search for specific strings. 

### First Example
<img width="405" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55414361/218595842-c4923aeb-08da-4184-800e-175154e0c9a8.png">

<img width="441" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55414361/218595696-a06dc56d-fdf2-42ed-bdf0-335b64316440.png">

<img width="436" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55414361/218595775-c3d6bdfd-7671-43bb-b9d8-c9fd31da43c2.png">

<img width="380" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55414361/218595802-1b7b52ec-7628-40c8-bd9a-730efcffe84b.png">

In the first picture, we use the less command to access the file. Then in the second picture we can see the content again. In the third image, I type in a new command 
called `/lagoon`. I use this command in order to look for the word "lagoon". In the fourth picture, we can see the word "lagoon" highlighted in different places. This
command works really well because it allows us to easily access the file and find exactly where the word we are looking for is. 

### Second Example

<img width="395" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55414361/218596198-5537ec9b-c6fc-4780-9c1b-a6970e90a321.png">

<img width="629" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55414361/218596221-8c4739f0-0288-4890-9af7-3788dc3d4770.png">

<img width="414" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55414361/218596248-9abb549c-0a3b-404b-bdaf-524ce3f4d186.png">

<img width="480" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55414361/218596289-354df021-d10f-4672-9cbc-1446203da29c.png">

In the first picture, we use the less command to access the file. Then in the second picture we can see the content again. I typed in a new command 
called `/channel`. I use this command in order to look for the word "channel". This step was just like the previous picture. In the fourth picture we can see the 
word "channel" highlighted in different places. However, I used the command `n` in order to move the page downwards so I could see other content. In the fourth picture, 
we can see how the word channel is in a different spot. This allows us to see the required word in many different places and allow us to see exactly where the word is. 

## 3. Using Pattern Search

Pattern search works similiarly to find except it follows a specified pattern.
