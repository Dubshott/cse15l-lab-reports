# Week 7 Lab Report

## Setup (SSH):
Before we start the challenge, we need to set up some things for our SSH so that we won't have to type in the password every single time when logging into our ieng6 account. In addition to this, I also connected the ieng6 account to github so that I don't have to provide authentication when I push or pull. This was all done with steps 1 to 3. 

Here is a picture of me running ssh to log into ieng6 without having to type in a password:

## Deleting existing forks

This is similiar to the setup since we are removing any copies that we already cloned.

This is the problem we face when setting this up so we need to fix this.

```
// These are the commands that were run
rm - r lab 7 <enter>
yes <enter>
ls <enter>
```

In short, we use `rm -r lab7` to remove the file and then used `ls` to check if the file was deleted.
